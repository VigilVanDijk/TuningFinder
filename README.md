# TuningFinder
Python script that finds the tuning of any song, implemented via Web Scraping using Selenium.
All elements located by using Xpaths, any other locator strategies returned too many errors.
The website used is my all time favorite for finding tabs, Ultimate Guitar.
Makr sure to enter the name of the song and artist correctly, else my guy get sconfused and return an element not found error
